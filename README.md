# Game of Life with Tribal Dynamics

This repository contains two implementations of Conway's Game of Life with tribal dynamics:

1. A Python/Pygame implementation
2. A native iOS SwiftUI app designed for iPhone 15 Pro

Both versions feature tribal dynamics where different colored "tribes" of cells compete for territory using Conway's Game of Life rules.

## Tribal Dynamics Rules

In this implementation of Conway's Game of Life, cells belong to different "tribes" (represented by different colors):

- Cells follow the standard Game of Life rules for survival and death:
  - A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighboring cells dies
  - A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighboring cells survives
  - A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighboring cells becomes alive

- For tribal dynamics:
  - When a new cell is born, it takes on the tribe of the majority of its 3 live neighbors
  - If there's a tie between tribes, a random tribe is chosen
  - Cells maintain their tribal identity until they die

## Python Version

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Running the Game
Run the game using:
```
python life.py
```

### Controls
- Click on cells to place/remove them when the game is paused
- Use the "Start" button to begin/pause the simulation
- Use the "Reset" button to clear the board
- Use the "Draw/Erase" button to toggle between drawing and erasing cells
- Select a tribe button to choose which tribe to draw

### Features
- Adapted for iPhone 15 Pro portrait aspect ratio (2.16:1)
- Supports multiple tribes with different colors
- Interactive UI for creating and controlling the simulation
- Touchscreen support for mobile devices

## iOS Version

The iOS app is a native SwiftUI implementation designed specifically for iPhone 15 Pro.

### Requirements
- Xcode 12 or later
- iOS 14.0 or later
- iPhone (optimized for iPhone 15 Pro)

### Building and Running
1. Open the IOSGameOfLife.xcodeproj file in Xcode
2. Select your target device (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
3. Build and run the app

### Features
- Designed for iPhone 15 Pro's portrait mode and screen dimensions
- Touch interface for creating and editing cells
- Smooth animations and performance optimization
- Support for tribal dynamics with multiple colored tribes
- Interface optimized for one-handed use on mobile

## Running on iPhone (including carrier-locked devices)

### Method 1: Web Browser (Recommended for carrier-locked iPhones)
This method works on all iPhones regardless of carrier lock status:

1. Visit the Game of Life web version at: `https://yourusername.github.io/gameoflife/`
2. For the best experience:
   - Use Safari browser in portrait orientation
   - Add to home screen: tap the share button (box with arrow) â†’ "Add to Home Screen"
   - Launch from the home screen icon for a fullscreen experience

### Method 2: Using Pythonista (for non-carrier restricted iPhones)
If your iPhone allows installation of Pythonista:

1. Purchase and install [Pythonista](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097) from the App Store
2. Import the `life.py` file via:
   - iCloud Drive
   - Email attachment
   - GitHub download
3. Install the pygame module in Pythonista using StaSh
4. Run the script from within Pythonista

### Note for Carrier-Locked iPhones
Carrier-locked iPhones have restrictions that may prevent installing certain apps outside the App Store. The web browser method (Method 1) works regardless of these restrictions since it runs in Safari, which comes pre-installed on all iPhones.
